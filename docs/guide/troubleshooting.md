# Troubleshooting

##### I have a `Error: Plugin GoogleMaps does not respond to method call` error message on iOS

In Xcode click on `Product` > `Clean Build Folder` and try to build again.

##### I have a `Cannot resolve symbol GoogleMaps` error message in Android Studio

In Android Studio click `File` > `Sync Project with Gradle Files` and try to build again.
